RIM

A PHP/Jquery template page to over-come strange behavior with screen size and element position. Place everything inside the rim. I called this 'rim' because I'm tired of getting f***ed by viewport and bad mobile browsers.
The four divs inside #rim are to be deleted before each use. Put all elements inside #rim.

.inp
Content editable divs that behave!
- watermarks with no extra elements
- color text for error or success easy to add
- paste
- no return and one line only
- css
