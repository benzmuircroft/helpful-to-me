RIM
===

> A PHP/Jquery template page to over-come strange behavior with screen size and element position. Place everything inside
> the rim. I called this 'rim' because I'm tired of getting f***ed by viewport and bad mobile browsers.
> The four divs inside #rim are to be deleted before each use. Put all elements inside #rim.

- Handles page resizes
- Always fits the screen on mobile (Size is 'as-is' on browsers)
- Makes viewport unnessesary
- rim widht/height px/% is now the correct standard for screen size and element position
- relative and absolute positions behave
