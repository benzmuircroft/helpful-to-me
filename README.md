replacement
===========

A PHP/Jquery template set to help with common tasks mostly using Jquery after ready attempting to simply and quickly bypass things that are normally hard to control and to taim new methods that currently have fuzzy implimentation. This code is developed for webkit only. Legacy gets left behind in this case as an old browser was new at one time but now it will in some way fail its internet driving lessons which means that it is now in fact 'incompatable software'. 

It is not the job of a developer to hack the old, it is a developers job to hack the new.

By encoraging people to migrate, saving time in development by showing that things may be switched off for legacy while providiing an alternative browser solution you succeed in developing for the future and people move over because they are otherwize missing the internet.

The goal of this project is to hack the new. While personally depreciating most standard html elements in favor of divs as a div can be made to look and act however and behaves as expected when used as a base element;

Redundant:
- button
- radio
- input
- viewport
